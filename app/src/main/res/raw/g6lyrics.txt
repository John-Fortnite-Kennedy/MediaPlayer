Poppin bottles in the ice, like a blizzard
When we drink we do it right, gettin' slizzard
Sippin' sizzurp in my ride, in my ride, like a Three 6
Now I'm feelin' so fly like a G6
Like a G6, like a G6
Now, now, now, now, now, now I'm feelin' so fly like a G6
Like a G6, like a G6
Now, now, now, now, now, now I'm feelin' so fly like a G6
Give me that Mo-Moet-wet
Give me that Cry-Crystal-tal
Ladies love my style, at my table gettin' wild
Get them bottles poppin, we get that drip and that drop
Now give me 2 more bottles 'cause you know it don't stop
Hell yeah
Drink it up, drink-drink it up,
When sober girls around me, they be actin' like they drunk
They be actin' like they drunk, actin'-actin' like they drunk
Whe, when sober girls around me they be actin' like they drunk-unk-unk
Poppin' bottles in the ice, like a blizzard
When we drink we do it right gettin' slizzard
Sippin' sizzurp in my ride, in my ride, like a Three 6
Now I'm feelin' so fly like a G6
Like a G6, like a G6
Now, now, now, now, now, now I'm feelin' so fly like a G6
Like a G6, like a G6
Now, now, now, now, now, now I'm feelin' so fly like a G6
Sippin on, sippin on sizz, I'ma ma-make it fizz
Girl I keep it gangster, poppin' bottles at the crib, crib
This is how we live, every single night
Take that bottle to the head, and let me see you fly
Hell yeah
Drink it up, drink-drink it up
When sober girls around me, they be actin' like they drunk
They be actin' like they drunk, actin' like they drunk
Whe, when sober girls around me they be actin' like they dru-u-unk
Poppin' bottles in the ice, like a blizzard
When we drink we do it right gettin slizzard
Sippin' sizzurp in my ride, in my ride, like Three 6
Now I'm feelin' so fly like a G6
Like a G6, like a G6
Now, now, now, now, now, now I'm feelin' so fly like a G6
Like a G6, like a G6
Now, now, now, now, now, now I'm feelin' so fly like a G6
